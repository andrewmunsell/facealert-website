### `Initial Release`
# **Version 1.0**

This is the initial release to FaceAlert. Currently, it supports hour-long training "sessions" that you can start from your Apple Watch app. During this training session you will receive vibrations on your watch when it detects you touch your face, as well as a live running tally. Once the training session is over, you will receive a notification telling you how many times you touched your face.
